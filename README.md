This is a Fork of the project [helm-nexus-push](https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/helm-nexus-push).  This version included fixes for the unix script and **Windows** support was added.

Nexus Helm repo.

## The Fine Print

It is worth noting that this is **NOT SUPPORTED** by Sonatype, and is a 
contribution of the community back to the open source community (read: you!)

Remember:

* Use this contribution at the risk tolerance that you have
* Do NOT file Sonatype support tickets related to Helm support in regard to this plugin
* DO file issues here on GitHub, so that the community can pitch in

Phew, that was easier than I thought. Last but not least of all:

Have fun creating and using this plugin and the Nexus platform, we are glad to have you here!
